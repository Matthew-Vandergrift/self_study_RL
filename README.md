#RL Study
This is simply a fun little project for my self to do as I'm reading and watching RL lectures. The code is not elegant or made for production, this is just a place for me to make sure I am absorbing the algorithms and not hyper focusing on the theory as I am occasionally known to do. 
If you're reading this, I suspect this repo will not be of much value to you, but you should read Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton which is where all the algorithms here are dicussed in depth.
